style H,W,WH (case insenstive) often used to describe musical scales or modes.
H meaning Halfstep, W for Wholestep, and combining H and W for Halfstep+Wholestep.
Piano keys that will be enabled are then determine from this root + formula pair
and any keys that are not in the resulting note-name list will be locked.
Set <lockToTonicWithScale> to empty to clear the scale and unlock all piano keys.
