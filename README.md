# OpenXTalk Builder Piano Widget
A Graphical Piano Keyboard Widget

## NOTE:

This Widget is a graphical UI element only. It produces no sound on it's own and is meant to be attached to a MIDI play back engine.
See my other Repos for Builder Wrappers for playback engines for Apple devices, as well as the cross-platform FluidSynth SoundFont engine. 
These are all a works in progress at the moment. I make no guarantee of their useablity.

### Version 1.3.5
- BUG FIX: lockToTonicWithScale property parsing. "3H","WH", or "HW" can now be used to indicate 3-halfstep distance in a scale formula.

### Version 1.3
- New lockToScale and lockToTonicWithScale properties for restricting to piano to a musical scale or mode

### Version 1.2
- New 'the colorNotes' property for colorizing individual piano keys with the format "R,G,B,A N,NN,N#,etc."
(exp. set the colorNotes of widget 1 to "255,255,255,127 C,E5" -- sets C notes on all octaves and the sinlge E note on 5th octave to 50% transparent white)
Sdetting to multiple lines of color _ note-list pairs is permitted.

### Version 0.8 thu 1.0
- Changed rendering system (back to SVG paths but from a more accurate drawing) and optimized method based on Bernd's code
- Allow for setting the keyboard range (-1 to 9) with new lowOctave and highOctave properties, changed octavesCount property and made read-only.
- Added property to set the outline strokeWidth and account for additional required space in rendering
- Implemented blackKeysColor/sharpsFlatsColor and whiteKeysColor/naturalsColor properties
- Implemented borderWidth and borderColor properties
- Updated Documentation, all current properties are now documented

### Version 0.1 thu 0.7
- Auto-hilighting chords via a chordFormula property
- Auto-hilighting chords via a chordPreset property and created a basic set of chord presets
- Setting and getting the highlights for individual keys on the piano via a hilitedNotes property
- Better graphics rendering with rounded rects instead of SVG Paths -- Thanks Bernd!
- Implemented hiliteColor property

## Roadmap:

### Version 1.5
- Shadow more of standard object properties such as focusBorder or fading colors for disabled look
- Implement ability to show text labels of piano key names (exmp.C#-4) on each key, and add properties to adjust font, size, color of text

### Version 2.0
- Implement Multi-Touch for Mobile Devices
- Vertical Oriented Piano Version
